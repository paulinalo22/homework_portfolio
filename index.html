                        <p> I'm a mexican that has a strange obsession with movies. Nevertheless, my academic and professional career has been diverse and a wee bit strange. I studied convervation 
                            biology as my undergraduate degree with the hope of FINISHING all future extinctions in Mexico. Once I realized that was a very unrealistic expectation, I noticed that 
                            the energy sector was one of the biggest contributors to climate change. Therefore, I switch my academic focus and decided to get a Master Sustainable Energy. Surprisingly,
                            my lecturers taught me that lack of education in developing countries is a detriment to sustainability. Thus, I decided that my path had to concentrate on  education (my mom 
                            and grandma are teacher so it had to be easy for me, right?). Thus, I did the exam (CENEVAL) to get my degree in Preschool Teaching, in order to teach younger generations.

                        <p> After making all those changes, I am still not fully satisfied with my current career (I believe I'm a bit dramatic). However, I discovered that software engineering is as a field that
                            can be used in pretty much any area. With this in mind, I think I will be able to merge all my current knowledge and apply it into a common field. I believe technology is an essential tool and I'm hoping 
                            to learn new skills that can be used in the education and sustainability sectors (and hopefully in the movie industry).
