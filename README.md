# homework_portfolio
This is the second homework assignment that consisted of developing a responsive portfolio. 
The website should be able to adjust to different screen sizes (in theory, let's hope it works).

The home page that includes a wee bit of informatiion about me and my Linkedin profile. 
The portfolio page includes spaces in which I'll be able to include future projects. 
Finally, in the contact page, people will be able to introduce their information.
